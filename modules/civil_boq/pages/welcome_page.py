        <h2>Estimate Cost and Qunatity ðŸ’°</h2>
        <p>A Bill of Quantities (BOQ) is a comprehensive document that lists all the materials, labor, and other costs required for a construction project. It breaks down every element, from building materials like concrete and steel to the finishing touches like paint and fixtures. A well-prepared BOQ helps to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accurately Estimate Costs:</strong> Know exactly how much your project will cost before starting.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamline Procurement:</strong> Make ordering materials simpler and more organized.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimize Wastage:</strong> Avoid over-purchasing materials by estimating quantities precisely.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Project Planning:</strong> Ensure all aspects of the project are accounted for in terms of materials and labor.</li>
        </ul>
